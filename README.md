## Goals

The main Goal of this project is to gain hands on experience with the SIEM solution Splunk.

it also serves as
- An avenue to build real world security monitoring skills
- A platform to show practical knowledge of log analysis skills
- A platform where beginners such as myself can learn as I learn about Splunk and it's capabilities

## Setting Up The Splunk Environment
This step involves downloading, installing, and configuring The Splunk SIEM on a host PC for data ingestion and analysis

- First thing we'll need to do is head over to Splunks website, setup an account and and Download Splunk Enterprise. For this project, I'll be making use of the free 60 days trial to get started.
